Capomulin Study 
Data Visualization Module 5
Pymaceuticals Inc. Summary by Katherine Layton
Summary of the results from a study to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Capomulin and Ramicane both show a marked decrease in tumor volume over this 45 day study.
Tumor Volume (mm3) measurements are lower for both mean and median, variance is low (tight). low standard deviation shows less variability in the data and the standard error of the mean shows more precision (than variability).

Here are the results of Mean, Median, Variance, St.Deviation and SEM calculations: Capomulin 40.675741 41.557809 24.947764 4.994774 0.329346 Ramicane 40.216745 40.673236 23.486704 4.846308 0.320955

Summary statistics also show Capomulin and Ramicane to be the most effective treatments for SCC.
The quartiles (Q1 and Q3) provide information about the spread of the data and where the middle 50% of the measurements fall.The IQR indicates the range within which the majority of measurements lie.The lower and upper bounds help identify potential outliers. Any data points falling outside these bounds are considered potential outliers. Potential outliers are specific data points that may be significantly different from the rest of the data.

Summary statistics for Capomulin:Lower Quartile: 32.37735684, Upper Quartile: 40.1592203, IQR: 7.781863460000004, Lower Bound: 20.70456164999999. Upper Bound: 51.83201549, Potential outliers: []

Summary statistics for Ramicane:Lower Quartile: 31.56046955, Upper Quartile: 40.65900627, IQR: 9.098536719999998, Lower Bound: 17.912664470000003, Upper Bound: 54.30681135. Potential outliers: []

Correlation results show tumor volume increases with mouse weight. Need to study more about obesity influence and side effects -including nausea, or lack of appetite.
The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84 (results using data with all Drug Regimens included). As this correlation is close to 1, there is a strong tendency for the tumor volume to increase as the weight of the mouse increased.
